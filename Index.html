            <h2>Hello!</h2>

            <p>I am a Second-year Computer Science student at the University of Leeds. I am passionate about software development and learning about new technologies, AI, programming and automation. Motivated and excited to learn new things. Also currently working as a part-time Maths tutor at White Rose Maths, Where I am constantly learning new skills such as team management and communication skills.

            <p>but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
